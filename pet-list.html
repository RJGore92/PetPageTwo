    <h1>Ranking my favorite three pets I've owned from first to last</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cody</strong>, <em>Golden Retriever</em>.  A very dear pet from my childhood and one I remember so dearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Jazzy Blue</strong>, <em>Mini Australian Shepherd</em>.  A playful, loving pup despite being a handful at sometimes.  <a href="pet-pics.html"> Pictures of Jazz can be found here </a></li>
      <li><strong>Coal</strong>, <em>Australian Shepherd Mix</em>.  Loving, gentle, and loyal, he is quite a sweetheart and by no means hostile to strangers.  Name given because of his coal-colored fur.</li>
